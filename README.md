Here is the hosted app -> [RepoLoader](https://share.streamlit.io/tancodes/repoloader/RepoLoader.py) ðŸŽ‰ 
#### **RepoLoader** is for the developers who are constantly visiting Github which will make their work a little bit easy. It will save the developers time to visit GitHub and search the username of the particular repo and changing tabs and all this stuff so We have made the work simpler. Just search the username and you will get only what the user want. Yeah, only Repos.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- User can also download the repo dataset in CSV so that user can also use it for analysis, etc.
- NO need of opening GitHub and searching for the repos.
- Gives the name of the owner and the number of repositories is there in that.
- Shows only Repos name , with the last updated date and with the project links.

### This is how the final web app looks!
